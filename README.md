# Lauch Interceptor Program
By Ayub Atif, Isac Arvidsson, Eva Despinoy, Daniel Helle

## Description of the program
As a part of a hypothetical anti-ballistic system, the decide() function 
generates a boolean signal which determines wether an interceptor should be 
launched based upon input radar tracking information. 

The boolean signal is based on the boolean outputs of 15 functions.

## How to use the program? 
Make a new object of class Decide(). Set all the parameters of the class as wished. Then run the decide() function, which will return a boolean indicating if the interceptor should be launched.
